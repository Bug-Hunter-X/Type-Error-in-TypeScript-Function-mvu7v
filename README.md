This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum. However, when calling the function with a string and a number, a type error occurs. This is because TypeScript's type system enforces type safety and prevents implicit type conversions. The solution shows how to address this by using type guards or type assertions.
